Software and hardware glitches or security breaches could cause accidents.  Hence my suggestion for stringent testing requirements.  If the AVs undergo extensive on-street testing with safety drivers and engineers, testing on a closed course without drivers, software stress testing, and regular mechanical inspection of the vehicle, computing hardware, and sensors, the danger will be minimized.

Though there is sometimes conflicting pressures on the engineers.  The best efforts are when regulators and the companies work together to understand the issues facing, and ask the right questions.  Further, the technology is increasingly moving at a much faster rate than regulations can keep up, hence a partnership between the private co and public entities is likely the most efficient.  As for capping speed, this needs to be absolutely not done, there may be times when the AV may need to accelerate to avoid an accident.  Again this is something that should be left up to the experts creating the vehicles.  As a parent of toddler, the use case of the AV not being able to recognize a child and their erratic behavior is at the forefront of my mind.  Thankfully I know that it is also at the forefront of the engineers working on the issue.  Furthermore, limiting where the vehicles can operate may have  unintended consequences.  Some of the promise of AVs is that as the technology expands, traffic is reduced, ride sharing made easier, and ultimately carbon emissions reduced.  Further, an interesting use case would be dropping off minors safely at school.  I do not feel companies should be required to share data at all.  It is their intellectual property.

My perception was that the Uber car didn’t perceive me or at least didn’t understand me as another vehicle. And there certainly was no sense of eye contact and communication.

One of these is the reliable detection of bicyclists. Another is, once you detect a bicyclist, what should the AV then do, and in which circumstances? The second part of this question is involved and there are no simple solutions to this. This first part is non-trivial, and although detection technologies exist, the position and pose of the bicyclist is very difficult to estimate by the AV within a margin of error that would permit both vehicles to coexist in most Pittsburgh traffic lanes. Other sensors need to be added to the AV, which I do not see on the vehicles that are circulating in Pittsburgh.  The FHWA has been offering research grants to the development of technologies that both detect bicyclists and provide autonomous behaviors, or autonomy-assisted behaviors, in the event of a situation that poses a danger to a bicyclist. I have written one such research proposal and am aware of others. Bicycle and pedestrian detectors for municipal buses exist and are being tested in cities such as NYC.  Advocacy should insist that the FHWA continue to support this research and that they also develop policies that are developed along with the AV technologies. They cannot just push one form of technology to make it commercially self-sustaining and hope that the other questions will be answered after there is a self-sustaining AV economic ecosystem. The risk in cost to human life is too great, and the nascent AV industry risks catastrophic failure if there are ""too many"" AV-bicyclist incidents.

(2) What does it mean to limit the speed of AVs when speed limits are already posted for streets. Why should AVs have different speed limits than other vehicles? A speed limit is a safety requirement for a street or neighborhood, not for a vehicle. (3) AVs can have better obstacle or child sensing than human operators. It depends on the criterial used for their DOT licensing. (4) The City of Pittsburgh has already commissioned crowdsourced data-gathering technologies to detect things like pot holes. What other data would you have AV companies provide? Then, if you require AV companies to provide that data, (a) they will have a right to sell it, and (b) there will be a need for laws that limit the data that government agencies - including municipalities - can collect on their citizens without being unconstitutional. This gets complicated very quickly.

Self-driving cars represent a lazy and non-environmental approach to the suddenly present problem of ""safety"" surrounding vehicles on the road. By their sheer power, motor vehicles in general are NOT safe, and the further you remove users from their connection with the vehicle, the less safe all the circumstances become. For instance, the move from manual transmission vehicles to automatic transmission freed up a hand to do other dangerous and distracting tasks while driving instead of using that hand to shift gears. These conveniences furthermore deprive users of a necessary understanding of the machine they are operating. For example, during the Toyota recall of the ""sticky accelerator,"" a man drove his family off a cliff because he didn't know to put the car in neutral. Self-driving cars will make us all even less aware of the machine's internal processes and how to deal with problems that may occur; to achieve our desire for safety, we must instead develop vehicles that reinforce our knowledge of their operation and our physical connection to their functions.   In addition, automation has a history of removing people from the picture and subsequently removing them from employment. Automation is NOT good for the economy in the long-term--only for short-term gains by a select few tech companies.

It does seem reasonable that some threshold of off-road testing has been completed successfully prior to use on the roads.

The speed limit that cars follow now is the speed limit that AVs use, so imposing another speed limit just for them seems unnecessary. For the school zone, are we talking about AVs as they are now, or once they are out on the market? When they are available for purchase, they will surely have a sufficient degree of sophistication in their software to handle just about any situation, including a school zone. At the moment, they should probably stay away from these areas, but the question seemed a bit vague.  Also, should AV's become so commonplace that they supplant human drivers on the majority of the roadways, speed limits will become unnecessary as they are designed based on what speed a human driver still feels safe when they are driving in a certain area. Since AVs won't have the same foibles as humans (i.e. texting, calling someone, putting on makeup, getting too into singing a song, etc.), they'll be able to operate much more safely at high speeds than we could ever hope to try.

They send human drivers out constantly to San Fransisco to collect as much bike data as possible because we are able to test different algorithms on replayed experience.   A week or so ago I was walking home from the bus and I saw a cyclist fly down the sidewalk into an intersection just as oncoming traffic had begun to roll forward. The cars were moving maybe 2-4MPH as this person crossed in-front of them (the biker going at least 20 MPH such that he was unable to stop when he realized he did not have right of way) and he collided with the car in the second lane.  This was fine - he was not hurt visibly and there was only minor scratching on the car however this is a case that autonomous cars likely would never have seen before, it certainly was not in our data-set which is a shame as this is a case where reaction is critical. If any of the current LIDAR based cars encountered this they would probably have been able to out-react the human driver and prevent collision - google's car most notably waits a few extra seconds before moving after a green light. But we can't know for certain - unless one was there and it was recording.  This is the real advantage of putting as many SAFE autonomous cars next to bikers and humans as possible - things are bound to happen and if we can collect enough of these fluke incidents we can have a much better understanding of autonomy, and more importantly we will be able to run new algorithms through a benchmark of fluke accidents and determine if these cars are safe to be moving without a human driver which is ultimately where this technology will end up.

That doesn't make them safe.      AV companies should focus on technologies that make human drivers safer instead of aiming directly for full autonomy.  Consider, airplane ""autopilots"" evolved over decades, and pilots have always been carefully trained to understand the limitations of each autopilot.  A good starting place would be driving modes that don't allow the driver to set a control speed in excess of the speed limit (or even that resist manual operation in excess of the speed limit) and that pull over and stop if the driver appears to be impaired.  Excess speed and impaired driving are each involved on over 30% of crashes (of course, both are involved in some crashes, so the total benefit would be less than 60%, but even if it's onl 40-50% that would be a huge social benefit in very short order).  This is more technically achievable that full autonomy    AVs should not be permitted to operate autonomously until (a) we're REALLY convinced they're safe for ALL road users (including peds, cyclists, kids, dogs, ...) and (b) it is clear what human will be held responsible for errors.  Assignment of responsibility for MVs lands on the driver -- where does it land for AVs?  ""some corporation"" is not acceptable.    AVs should obey all laws.  Including stop signs and speed limits and yielding to pedestrians.  Violations should be auto-reported and fines assessed.  If there were lots of AVs obeying laws, maybe more humans would, too.    We hear periodic suggestions that cyclists, pedestrians, etc should wear ""beacons"" to help AV systems.  This is completely unacceptable.  Responsibility should remain with AV companies.
